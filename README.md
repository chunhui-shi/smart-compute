###Online CS Courses' Resource

For people to self study core computer science courses, I collected a series of classes with available assignments, notes, lecture videos from CMU, Stanford and MIT in this [wiki page](https://github.com/chunhui-shi/smart-compute/wiki/CS-Courses-Online-for-Self-Study)

The courses include here all have their materials(lectures, assignments, labs) available online and people should not be blocked from accessing lab materials. I tried to find out the textbooks online too but most of them are not requiring a formal textbooks.
